# next-game-engine

A scratch-like text-based game engine that supports Python and JavaScript.

# Installing

First install node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Now just start a terminal/cmd and run:

```shell
npx install-next-engine
```

That's it! This should now have set up the engine to the directory you
opened the terminal in!

You can now start the engine by just clicking to the
`run.cmd` or `run.vbs`(For windows) or `run.sh`(For linux/osx) file
in the directory it installed the engine in.
