# next-game-engine

A scratch-like text-based game engine that supports Python and JavaScript.

# Installing

First install node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Now just start a terminal/cmd and run:

### For Windows:

```shell
curl -O https://oguzhanumutlu.github.io/next-game-engine/install/setup.cmd && ./setup.cmd
```

### For Linux:

```shell
curl https://oguzhanumutlu.github.io/next-game-engine/install/setup.sh | bash
```

That's it! This should now have set up the engine to the directory you
opened the terminal in!

You can now start the engine by just clicking to the `run.cmd`(For windows)
or `run.sh`(For linux/osx) file in the directory it installed the engine in.
